        Junior teams start with the under-9s, and continue up to the under-17s.
        Our Junior section is incredibly popular for both boys and girls, and as
        well as coaching, teams and leagues, we also organise school holiday
        camps which include a visit to a live cricket match.

      <p>
        We have some great young players with a bright sporting future ahead of
        them, and some of our former juniors have gone on to incredible success
        - including Warwickshire and England batsman Ian Bell
      </p>

        Bar stocks a wide range of drinks and snacks, as well as a full-size
        snooker table and a pool table. We also have Sky and BT Sport, so
